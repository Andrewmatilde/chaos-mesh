                                          relates the key and values.

                                      A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                                      relates the key and values.

                                feature and more powerful. You can define stressors in `stress-ng` (see also `man stress-ng`) dialect,
                                however not all of the supported stressors are well tested. It maybe retired in later releases. You
                                should always use `Stressors` to define the stressors and use this only when you want more stressors
                                unsupported by `Stressors`. When both `StressngStressors` and `Stressors` are defined, `StressngStressors`
                                wins.
